SanDOx is an open source IDE built as a browser app that consist of tool panels. SanDOx IDE is supposed to have a built-in base list of tool panels with an ability to add personal panels in the form of plug-ins.

Supposed base list of panels:
Project – shows project structure with catalogues and files.
Console –displays results of the user’s code, “console” native object methods (log, warn, info, etc.)
Network – network choice and connection. A user could switch between Polkadot ecosystem parachains, connection code will be generated automatically.
Examples – examples library. Will include different case examples, which could be imported and run.
Find – search panel. Allows search of documents in a project and make multi autocorrect.
Personal panels – user defined and customized.
